        this doesnâ€™t prevent the field from being present in the queried object; it simply excludes 
        it from the data loaded from the database. If you want to filter out fields before sending 
        them over HTTP, you can use a custom toObject() transformation1. Additionally, if youâ€™re specifically
         dealing with password fields, consider using User.find().select('-password') to exclude the password
